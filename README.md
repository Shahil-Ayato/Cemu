       Cemu is a Nintendo Wii U emulator that is able to run most Wii U games and homebrew in a playable state. Created by Exzap, and written in C/C++.
       This emulator aims at providing both high-accuracy and performance, and is actively being developed with new features and fixes to increase compatibility,              convenience and usability.
       It was written from scratch and development on the project began roughly early 2015. Cemu is available on Github under the <a href="https://github.com/cemu-project/Cemu/blob/main/LICENSE.txt" target="_blank">MPL License</a>. <br />

## Issues

Issues with the emulator should be filed using [Github Issues](https://github.com/cemu-project/Cemu/issues).  
The old bug tracker can be found at [bugs.cemu.info](http://bugs.cemu.info) and still contains relevant issues and feature suggestions.

## Contributing

Pull requests are very welcome. For easier coordination you can visit the developer discussion channel on Discord: [https://discord.gg/5psYsup](https://discord.gg/5psYsup).
